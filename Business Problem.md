### Business Problem: Chocolate Sales Performance Analysis and Optimization

The company specializes in the production and distribution of chocolates across various regions. With 13 months of sales and shipment data, the goal is to identify actionable insights to improve sales, optimize costs, and enhance operational efficiency. Due to limited historical data, year-over-year (YoY) comparisons are not feasible, but Month-over-Month (MoM) and Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) trends will provide valuable insights for short-term performance monitoring.

## **1. Sales Performance Analysis**

#### **DAX Measures**
1. **Total Sales**:
   ```DAX
   Total Sales = SUM(Fact_Shipments[Amount])
   ```

2. **Total Boxes Shipped**:
   ```DAX
   Total Boxes = SUM(Fact_Shipments[Boxes])
   ```

3. **Average Sales per Box**:
   ```DAX
   Avg Sales per Box = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Boxes])
   ```

4. **Sales by Region**:
   ```DAX
   Sales by Region = 
   SUMMARIZE(
       Dim_Geography,
       Dim_Geography[Region],
       "Region Sales", SUM(Fact_Shipments[Amount])
   )
   ```

5. **Top Products by Sales**:
   ```DAX
   Top Products = 
   TOPN(
       5,
       SUMMARIZE(
           Dim_Products,
           Dim_Products[Product],
           "Product Sales", SUM(Fact_Shipments[Amount])
       ),
       [Product Sales], DESC
   )
   ```

---

### **2. Cost and Profitability Analysis**

#### **DAX Measures**
1. **Total Cost**:
   ```DAX
   Total Cost = 
   SUMX(
       Fact_Shipments,
       Fact_Shipments[Boxes] * RELATED(Dim_Products[Cost_per_box])
   )
   ```

2. **Total Profit**:
   ```DAX
   Total Profit = [Total Sales] - [Total Cost]
   ```

3. **Profit Margin (%)**:
   ```DAX
   Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales]) * 100
   ```

4. **Cost by Region**:
   ```DAX
   Cost by Region = 
   SUMMARIZE(
       Dim_Geography,
       Dim_Geography[Region],
       "Total Cost", [Total Cost]
   )
   ```

---

### **3. Shipment Volume and Efficiency**

#### **DAX Measures**

   ```DAX
   Total Shipments = SUM(Fact_Shipments[Boxes])
   ```

2. **Low Volume Shipments (<50 Boxes)**:
   ```DAX
   Low Volume Shipments = 
   CALCULATE(
       COUNT(Fact_Shipments[ShipmentID]),
       Fact_Shipments[Boxes] < 50
   )
   ```

3. **Pending Shipments**:
   ```DAX
   Pending Shipments = 
   CALCULATE(
       COUNT(Fact_Shipments[ShipmentID]),
       Fact_Shipments[Order_Status] = "Pending"
   )

   )
   ```

3. **Cumulative Sales**:

### Next Steps
1. **Define Relationships**:
   - Fact_Shipments â†’ Dim_Products, Dim_Geography, Dim_Salesperson, Dim_Calendar.
2. **Load the above DAX measures into Power BI**.
3. **Build dashboards with visuals** using slicers for interactivity.
