### **My First Python Program**

Once you have set up your Python IDE, you can write and execute your first program. Here’s an example:

1. **Write Your Program**:
   Open your IDE and enter the following code:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

2. **Save the File**:
   - Save the file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `hello.py`.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - **In IDLE**: Press `F5` to run the program.
   - **In VS Code or PyCharm**: Click the "Run" button or execute the file in the terminal:
     ```bash
     python hello.py
     ```

4. **Output**:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

### **Python Shell**

The **Python Shell** (or REPL – Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop) is an interactive environment where you can execute Python code line-by-line. It is ideal for testing small snippets of code or learning Python interactively.

1. **Start the Python Shell**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python` or `python3` and press Enter.

2. **Using the Shell**:
   - You can enter commands directly, and the shell will execute them immediately.
   - Example:
     ```python
     >>> print("Hello from the Shell!")
     Hello from the Shell!
     >>> 5 + 3
     8
     ```

3. **Exit the Shell**:
   - Type `exit()` or press `Ctrl+D` (on Linux/macOS) or `Ctrl+Z` (on Windows) to leave the shell.

### **Choosing Between an IDE and the Shell**

| **Feature**              | **Python Shell**                     | **Python IDE**                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Best For**              | Quick experiments and testing code   | Writing, debugging, and managing projects |
| **Ease of Use**           | Simple and interactive               | Requires setup but provides advanced features |
| **Code Organization**     | Not ideal for large projects         | Perfect for structured development    |
| **Learning Curve**        | Minimal                              | Moderate                             |

# **Basic Python Programming**


Let’s start with a simple program that asks for user input and displays output.

#### **Example: Greeting the User**
```python
# A program to greet the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Namaste, {name}! Welcome to Python programming.")
```

**How It Works**:
- **Input**: The `input()` function allows the user to type their name.
- **Output**: The `print()` function displays a personalized greeting.

Here’s the instruction written in a clear and structured format:

```markdown
## **Run the Program**:

1. Save the code in a file named `greet.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `greet.py` is saved.
4. Run the program by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
   ```
   python greet.py
   ```
5. **Example Interaction**:
   ```
   Enter your name: Ravi
   Namaste, Ravi! Welcome to Python programming.
   ```


---

#### **Example: Adding Two Numbers**
```python
# Program to add two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
sum_result = num1 + num2
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_result}")
```

**Run the Program**:
- Save this code as `add_numbers.py` and execute it.
- Example Interaction:
  ```
  Enter the first number: 12.5
  Enter the second number: 8.4
  The sum of 12.5 and 8.4 is 20.9
  ```

---

#### **Example: Indian Railways Ticket Price Calculator**
```python
# Calculate train ticket cost
distance = float(input("Enter the distance (in km): "))
price_per_km = 1.2  # Example rate in INR per km
total_cost = distance * price_per_km
print(f"The total ticket price for {distance} km is ₹{total_cost:.2f}")
```

**Run the Program**:
- Save as `ticket_price.py` and execute it.
- Example Interaction:
  ```
  Enter the distance (in km): 200
  The total ticket price for 200 km is ₹240.00
  ```

### **Getting Help**

Python provides built-in tools to guide beginners while writing code.

#### **Using the `help()` Function**
The `help()` function is a built-in utility that displays information about Python objects, functions, and modules.

**Example**:
```python
help(print)
```
**Output**:
```
Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

print(...)
    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
```

#### **Using the `dir()` Function**
The `dir()` function lists all methods and attributes of an object or module.

**Example**:
```python
name = "India"
print(dir(name))
```
**Output**:
```
['capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', ..., 'upper', 'zfill']
```

#### **Interactive Help in Python Shell**
- Open the Python Shell by typing `python` in your terminal or command prompt.
- Start interactive help:
   ```python
   help()
   ```
   Follow the prompts to explore topics.
- Exit help:
   ```python
   quit
   ```

### **Key Points for Beginners**
- **Input and Output**:
   - `input()` takes user input as a string.
   - `print()` displays output.
- **Variables**:
   - Variables store data and can be of different types (e.g., string, integer, float).
   - Example:
     ```python
     age = 20  # Integer
     name = "Ravi"  # String
     pi = 3.14  # Float
     ```
- **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Python supports basic operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
   - Example:
     ```python
     a = 10
     b = 5
     print(a + b)  # Output: 15
     ```

These beginner-friendly examples ensure students learn Python programming basics while engaging with real-life scenarios familiar in an Indian context.
