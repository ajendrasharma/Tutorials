    "# 📝 **Python Conditional Statements – Comprehensive Tutorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different code depending on whether a condition is **True** or **False**. They are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program. In this tutorial, we’ll cover the different types of conditional statements, syntax, best practices, and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 **What are Conditional Statements?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements enable you to **make decisions** in your code based on certain conditions. Python provides the following conditional statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`if` Statement**\n",
    "2. **`if-else` Statement**\n",
    "3. **`if-elif-else` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 **1. The `if` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`if` statement** executes a block of code only if a specified condition is **True**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are eligible to vote.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 **2. The `if-else` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`if-else` statement** provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is **False**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if condition is True\n",
    "else:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📌 **3. The `if-elif-else` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`if-elif-else` statement** allows you to check multiple conditions. If one condition is True, the corresponding block of code will execute, and the remaining conditions are skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if condition1 is True\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if all conditions are False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: A\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: B\")\n",
    "elif score >= 70:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: C\")\n",
