   - Serve as the building blocks of a data model.

2. **Columns (Fields):**
   - Attributes or properties of a table (e.g., Product Name, Customer ID).

3. **Keys:**
   - **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for each row in a table.
   - **Foreign Key:** Column that links one table to another.

4. **Relationships:**
   - Define how tables interact with each other (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

5. **Cardinality:**
   - Describes the type of relationship (e.g., 1:1, 1:many).

6. **Filters:**
   - Define how data flows between related tables (single-direction or bidirectional).

---

### **Types of Data Models**
1. **Conceptual Data Model:**
   - High-level overview of the data structure.
   - Focuses on defining entities and their relationships.

---

## **Table in Power BI?**

In Power BI, a **table** is a structured collection of rows and columns that stores related data. Tables form the backbone of data models in Power BI, where each table represents an entity or a set of data points. They can be imported from various sources (e.g., Excel, SQL databases, CSV files) or created directly within Power BI.

---

## **Types of Tables in Power BI**

Power BI supports various types of tables, each with a specific role in the data model. These include:

---

#### **1. Fact Tables**
- **Definition:** 
  - A fact table contains numerical and measurable data, often representing transactional information such as sales, revenue, or inventory.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Central table in a star or snowflake schema.
  - Contains foreign keys to connect with dimension tables.
  - Stores data at the lowest granularity (e.g., each transaction or sale).
- **Examples:**
  - Sales table with columns like OrderID, ProductID, CustomerID, SaleAmount, Date.
  - Inventory table with columns like ItemID, StockQuantity, Date.
- **Use Case:**
  - Summarize and analyze metrics such as total sales, average order value, or inventory trends.

---

#### **2. Dimension Tables**
- **Definition:**
  - A dimension table contains descriptive or categorical information about the entities involved in the fact table.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Connected to fact tables through foreign keys.
  - Contains textual and categorical data like names, locations, or product categories.
- **Examples:**
  - Customers table with columns like CustomerID, Name, Country, Age.
  - Products table with columns like ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price.
- **Use Case:**
  - Filters and slices the data in fact tables for detailed analysis.

---

#### **3. Lookup Tables**
- **Definition:**
  - A lookup table is a type of dimension table that provides a reference for unique identifiers, enabling relationships with other tables.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Similar to dimension tables but often smaller in size.
  - May include a list of unique codes or identifiers (e.g., country codes, region IDs).
- **Examples:**
  - Country lookup table with CountryID and CountryName.
  - Payment method lookup table with PaymentID and PaymentType.
- **Use Case:**
  - Used to connect unrelated tables through a shared key.

---

#### **4. Calculated Tables**
- **Definition:**
  - Tables created within Power BI using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
- **Characteristics:**
  - Derived from existing tables or columns.
  - Useful for creating subsets of data, aggregations, or custom datasets.
- **Examples:**
  - A table showing only top customers based on sales.
  - A table aggregating monthly sales from daily transactions.
- **Use Case:**
  - Create dynamic tables based on specific business requirements.

---

#### **5. Aggregation Tables**
- **Definition:**
  - Pre-aggregated tables used to improve performance by summarizing data.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Contains summarized data like total sales by region or monthly averages.
  - Reduces the need for on-the-fly calculations.
- **Examples:**
  - A table with total revenue by year and region.
  - Average customer ratings by product category.
- **Use Case:**
  - Optimize performance when working with large datasets.

## **Different Configurations of Data Modeling**

Data modeling configurations refer to the ways data is structured and organized within a model to facilitate analysis. Each configuration has specific use cases, strengths, and limitations. The three primary configurations in data modeling are **Star Schema**, **Snowflake Schema**, and **Galaxy Schema**. 

---

### 1. **Star Schema**
#### **Overview:**
- A simple and widely used configuration.
- Composed of a central **fact table** surrounded by multiple **dimension tables**.
- Called "star" schema because of its star-like layout.

#### **Structure:**
- **Fact Table:** Contains numerical data (e.g., sales, revenue) and foreign keys.
- **Dimension Tables:** Contain descriptive data (e.g., customer names, product categories).

#### **Key Features:**
- Denormalized structure (reduces joins and improves performance).
- Simplifies querying and report generation.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Dashboards requiring fast query performance.
- Summarized reporting like sales or marketing analytics.

#### **Example:**
- Fact Table: **Sales** (Sale Amount, Product ID, Customer ID, Date Key).
- Dimensions: **Products**, **Customers**, **Time**.

---

### 2. **Snowflake Schema**
#### **Overview:**
- A variation of the star schema.
- Dimension tables are further normalized into sub-tables.
- Resembles a snowflake due to its branching structure.

#### **Structure:**
- **Fact Table:** Same as in the star schema.
- **Dimension Tables:** Split into multiple related tables.

#### **Key Features:**
- Normalized structure reduces data redundancy.
- Requires more joins, leading to slower query performance compared to a star schema.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Complex data models with high data granularity.
- When storage optimization is a priority.

#### **Example:**
- Dimension Table: **Products** split into **Product Categories** and **Product Subcategories**.

# DAX Notes

## **Introduction to DAX**

Data Analysis eXpressions (DAX) is a specialized formula language used in Power BI to define custom calculations. DAX is designed to enhance the analytical capabilities of your data model by allowing users to create complex calculations, aggregations, and transformations on data.

DAX includes a wide range of functions such as arithmetic operators, logical functions, date and time functions, aggregation functions, and filtering functions. These functions can be combined to form expressions that yield meaningful insights based on your data model. 

DAX is used primarily in two ways:
- **Calculated Columns**: To create new columns of data based on formulas.
- **Measures**: To create aggregated values based on the context of the report.

---

### Calculated Columns

A **Calculated Column** is a new column that you can add to a table in your data model by using a DAX formula. This column is calculated based on the data of the entire table or specific rows, and its value is stored in the data model. Calculated columns are computed during data refresh or when data is loaded into the model.

### Key Features of Calculated Columns:
- **Row Context**: Calculated columns are evaluated on a row-by-row basis. This means that each row is processed independently, and the formula uses values from the current row for the calculation. This is known as "row context." Calculated columns are useful when you need to perform operations that apply to individual rows of data (e.g., adding a discount column based on a price or creating a new category for customers based on sales volume).
  
- **Visible in Both Data and Report View**: Once a calculated column is created, it is visible in both the Data view and Report view. You can use these columns in your visualizations or even as filters in reports.

- **Statistical Functions**: Basic aggregate functions like SUM, AVERAGE, or COUNT are not typically useful within calculated columns because they operate over multiple rows, and calculated columns inherently work at the row level. However, functions like IF, SWITCH, and DATEADD can be used to calculate values at the row level.

- **Impact on Model Size**: Since calculated columns add new data to the data model (essentially creating new columns), they increase the overall file size. The values are stored in memory with the data and can significantly impact performance, especially in large datasets.

- **Example**: You could use a calculated column to create a "TotalPrice" column in a sales table by multiplying the "Quantity" column by the "Price" column for each row.

**Example DAX Formula for a Calculated Column**:
```DAX
TotalPrice = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Price]
```

---

### Measures

A **Measure** is a formula that returns a single value based on an aggregation or computation. Measures are calculated on the fly based on the context of the report or filters applied to the data. Unlike calculated columns, measures do not add new columns to the data model, but instead, they dynamically compute values based on the report's filters and slicers.

### Key Features of Measures:
- **Filter Context**: Measures evaluate values based on the "filter context" in which they are used. The filter context is defined by any filters, slicers, or conditions applied in the report. For example, if you place a measure in a chart or table and apply a date filter, the measure will automatically calculate the result based on the filtered date range. This dynamic evaluation makes measures ideal for calculating summaries, aggregations, and totals.

- **Visible Only in Report View**: Measures cannot be seen in Data view. They only appear in the Report view where they are used to provide aggregate calculations for visuals, tables, and charts. Measures are dynamic, meaning their values change depending on the applied filters or slicers in the report.

- **Aggregation and Computation**: Measures are particularly useful for calculations that involve aggregation across rows, such as summing sales, calculating averages, or finding the maximum or minimum value of a column. They can use functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and other complex DAX functions to perform the required computation.

- **Does Not Impact Model Size**: Measures do not increase the file size of the data model because they do not store new data in the model. They are calculated on the fly, so the model size remains unaffected by the addition of measures.

- **Example**: You could create a measure to calculate the total sales for a filtered set of data, where the calculation will change based on the filters in the report (such as by year or region).

**Example DAX Formula for a Measure**:
```DAX
TotalSales = SUM(Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Price])
```

---

**4. Measures vs. Calculated Columns: A Detailed Comparison**

| Feature                     | **Calculated Columns**                               | **Measures**                                    |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                  | Used for adding new data to a table.                 | Used for aggregated or calculated values based on filter context. |
| **Calculation Context**      | Works with row context; calculated on a row-by-row basis. | Works with filter context; calculated based on applied filters. |
| **Visibility**               | Visible in both Data and Report view.                | Visible only in Report view (cannot be seen in Data view). |
| **Storage Impact**           | Increases the file size as they are stored in the data model. | Does not increase the file size; calculated dynamically. |
| **Usage**                    | Ideal for creating new columns of data for further analysis or categorization. | Ideal for aggregating and summarizing data (e.g., total sales, averages). |
| **Calculation Type**         | Typically used for row-based operations.             | Typically used for aggregate-level calculations. |
| **Performance**              | May impact performance due to storage requirements, especially with large datasets. | Typically more efficient since calculations are done on demand and do not require storage. |
| **Examples**                 | Total price of each item in a sales table, Age category based on date of birth. | Total sales for a specific time period, Average revenue per customer. |

---

**5. Choosing Between Measures and Calculated Columns**

The choice between creating a measure or a calculated column depends on the type of calculation you need and how the data will be used:
- **Use a calculated column** when you need to create a new value for each row of the dataset. For example, you may want to categorize products based on sales performance or create flags that indicate specific conditions for each row.
  
- **Use a measure** when you need to calculate aggregated values such as sums, averages, or other metrics that depend on filter context. Measures are best when your calculations need to change dynamically based on the context in which they are used (e.g., filtered by time, region, or other slicers).


### Detailed Notes on Adding Measures, Implicit & Explicit Measures

---

**Adding Measures**

In Power BI or other tools that support DAX, you can add **measures** in two primary ways:

1. **Right-click within the Table**:  
   You can create a measure by right-clicking on the table in the Fields pane and selecting **New Measure**. This opens the formula bar where you can type your DAX expression to define the measure. This method provides full flexibility to create any type of measure based on your requirements.

2. **Using “Quick Measures”**:  
   Quick Measures in Power BI allow you to create common calculations without writing any DAX code manually. You can find Quick Measures in the "Modeling" tab, where you can select from a range of predefined measures like running totals, year-to-date calculations, or percentage of total. This is an excellent way to quickly add calculations without deep knowledge of DAX functions, though it is less flexible than writing custom DAX.

---

**Implicit vs. Explicit Measures**

Measures in Power BI (and other tools supporting DAX) can be classified into two categories: **Implicit Measures** and **Explicit Measures**. Understanding the difference between these two types of measures is crucial for choosing the appropriate method for calculation, depending on the scenario.

---

### **Implicit Measures**

**Implicit Measures** are automatically created when you drag a numerical field (e.g., Sales, Revenue, Quantity) into the Values pane of a visualization in the Report view and then choose a predefined aggregation like **Sum**, **Count**, **Average**, etc.

- **Automatic Creation**: Implicit measures are created automatically when you perform aggregations such as sum, count, or average directly in the report.
  
- **No DAX Code Required**: Implicit measures do not require any DAX expression. You simply choose the aggregation type, and Power BI automatically handles the calculation behind the scenes.

- **Limitations**: Implicit measures are tied to the specific visualization where they are created. They cannot be reused in other parts of the report or used in other DAX calculations. You cannot access these measures from the Fields pane in the report. They are effectively **hidden** from other parts of the report or model.

- **Visibility**: You will only see implicit measures in the visualization where they were created. They don’t appear as independent fields in the Fields pane.

- **Examples**:  
  - If you drag the "Sales" field into a table and select "Sum", Power BI creates an implicit measure for the sum of sales.
  - If you drag the "Quantity" field into a chart and select "Average", Power BI creates an implicit measure for the average quantity.

---

### **Explicit Measures**

**Explicit Measures** are created by writing a custom DAX expression. These measures can be calculated and used anywhere in the report, making them much more versatile than implicit measures.

- **Manual Creation**: To create an explicit measure, you need to write a DAX formula using the formula bar. This formula can include a wide variety of DAX functions, from simple aggregations like SUM and AVERAGE to complex calculations involving logical operations, filters, and conditions.

- **Reusable**: Unlike implicit measures, explicit measures can be used in multiple visualizations and across the entire report. They are accessible from the Fields pane and can be reused in different parts of your report.

- **Flexible**: Explicit measures can reference other measures, fields, and tables. They can also be used in other DAX calculations, giving you much more flexibility in creating complex analytics.

- **Visibility**: Explicit measures appear as separate fields in the Fields pane, and they are visible and available to use throughout the report. They can also be referenced in other DAX calculations, making them essential for building advanced analytics.

- **Examples**:
  - A measure to calculate total sales:  
    ```DAX
    TotalSales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
    ```
  - A measure to calculate Year-to-Date (YTD) sales:
    ```DAX
    YTDSales = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Dates[Date])
    ```

- **Advanced Use**: Explicit measures can also be used in other DAX formulas, which means they can be combined with other calculations to create more sophisticated metrics (e.g., calculating growth rates, filtering based on conditions, or calculating weighted averages).

---

### **Differences Between Implicit and Explicit Measures**

| Feature                          | **Implicit Measures**                           | **Explicit Measures**                             |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Creation Method**              | Automatically created by Power BI when you use predefined aggregation functions (e.g., Sum, Average). | Manually created by the user through DAX expressions. |
| **DAX Code**                     | No DAX code involved, aggregation is predefined. | Requires DAX code for custom calculations. |
| **Reusability**                  | Cannot be reused across different visualizations or calculations. | Can be reused anywhere in the report or model. |
| **Visibility**                   | Only visible in the specific visualization where the measure was created. | Visible in the Fields pane and can be used across the entire report. |
| **Customization**                | Limited to predefined aggregations (Sum, Count, Average, etc.). | Highly customizable with any DAX function. |
| **Flexibility**                  | Limited flexibility, as it only works for simple aggregation. | Can perform complex calculations and interact with other fields or measures. |
| **Access**                       | Only accessible within the visualization where created. | Can be accessed and referenced anywhere in the report or model. |

---

**Conclusion**

- **Implicit Measures** are quick, automatic calculations that Power BI creates when you drag numerical fields into visualizations and select an aggregation like Sum, Average, or Count. They are simple and quick but are confined to the specific visualization and cannot be reused.
  
- **Explicit Measures** are custom calculations written using DAX expressions. They are highly flexible, reusable across the entire report, and can be used in other DAX calculations, making them a powerful tool for advanced analysis.



## **Data Types in DAX**

DAX supports several data types that are used in calculations, functions, and expressions. These data types define the kind of data that a column or value can hold. The main data types in DAX are:

1. **Numeric**:
   - This type includes both integer and floating-point numbers. It is used for values that require mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
   - Example: `Sales[Amount] = 1000`

2. **Boolean**:
   - This data type holds **TRUE** or **FALSE** values. It is commonly used in logical expressions and conditional statements.
   - Example: `IsHighValue = IF(Sales[Amount] > 5000, TRUE(), FALSE())`

3. **Date/Time**:
   - The Date/Time type is used to store date and time values. DAX provides specific functions to manipulate and format date and time values, which is critical in time-based analysis (e.g., YTD, QTD, etc.).
   - Example: `OrderDate = DATE(2024, 12, 26)`

4. **String**:
   - The String data type represents text or alphanumeric data. It can hold any sequence of characters, such as names, categories, descriptions, etc.
   - Example: `ProductCategory = "Electronics"`

5. **Decimal**:
   - This data type is used for precise numerical values, typically used in financial or scientific calculations where accuracy is crucial.
   - Example: `Price = 99.99`

These data types form the basis for how DAX functions interact with data and ensure correct handling of data types during calculations.

#### **Benefits of Using Variables in DAX**

Variables in DAX can provide significant advantages in terms of readability, performance, and logic in your expressions. The key benefits of using variables are:

1. **Reuse of Values**:  
   - By declaring a variable, you can store a value or calculation once and reuse it multiple times within a DAX expression. This reduces the need for recalculating the same value repeatedly, leading to **improved performance**. For example, if you have a complex calculation that needs to be used multiple times, you can assign it to a variable and reference it as needed, rather than recalculating it every time.
   - Example:
     ```DAX
     VAR SalesAmount = SUM(Sales[Amount])
     RETURN SalesAmount * 0.1
     ```

2. **Improved Readability and Maintainability**:  
   - Variables help make DAX expressions more **logical** and easier to read. Complex expressions can be broken down into smaller, more manageable components using variables. This improves the understanding and maintenance of your DAX code.
   - For instance, instead of writing a lengthy expression all in one line, you can define intermediate steps using variables.
   
3. **Avoid Additional Queries to the Source Database**:  
   - By using variables, you can **avoid querying the source database** repeatedly for the same value. Once a variable is declared and evaluated, it holds the result, and subsequent references to that variable use the stored value. This is particularly useful in large datasets where repeated queries to the database can negatively impact performance.
   
4. **Scoped Variables**:  
   - Variables in DAX are **scoped** to the measure or query in which they are defined. This means the variable exists only within the specific context of the measure, and it will not persist outside that context. This ensures that variables do not interfere with other calculations or measures in the data model.
   - Variables are especially useful in **measures**, where you define and calculate intermediate values that are part of the final result of the measure.

5. **Performance Optimization**:  
   - In complex calculations involving multiple steps, using variables can enhance performance because the values are calculated once and stored temporarily. This minimizes repetitive calculations and optimizes resource usage.

**Example of Using Variables in DAX**:
```DAX
ProfitMargin = 
VAR TotalRevenue = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
VAR TotalCost = SUM(Sales[Cost])
VAR Profit = TotalRevenue - TotalCost
RETURN Profit / TotalRevenue
```
In this example, three variables (`TotalRevenue`, `TotalCost`, and `Profit`) are defined to break down the calculation into logical steps, making the expression easier to understand and more efficient to evaluate.

## `CALCULATE` Function in DAX

The `CALCULATE` function is one of the most important and versatile functions in **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)**. It is primarily used to modify the filter context of a calculation, enabling users to perform complex aggregations and evaluations based on dynamic criteria. It allows you to apply additional filters to your measures or calculations and change the evaluation context.

---

### **Syntax of `CALCULATE`**

```DAX
CALCULATE(Expression, Filter1, Filter2, ...)
```

- **Expression**: The DAX expression or measure to be evaluated. This can be an aggregation or any other DAX function that you wish to calculate.
  
- **Filter1, Filter2, ...**: One or more filter expressions that modify the filter context. These can be simple filters on columns, or more complex expressions that evaluate a subset of data based on specified conditions.

The `CALCULATE` function allows you to **change the context** of the expression it evaluates. This is done by applying the filters provided to the function.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Filter Context**: In DAX, the **filter context** refers to the set of filters that apply to a calculation. These filters can come from various sources:
   - Explicit filters (such as filters applied in the Report view).
   - Implicit filters (such as relationships between tables).
   - Context from slicers or other visual elements.

2. **Context Transition**: When you use `CALCULATE`, it **transitions from row context** to **filter context**. This means that instead of calculating a value for a single row in a table, it calculates the result based on the filters applied across a table or column.

3. **Evaluation**: The `CALCULATE` function evaluates an expression in a modified context, meaning that you can control the way the data is filtered and aggregated.

---

### **Common Uses of `CALCULATE`**

The `CALCULATE` function is used for a wide range of scenarios in DAX. Below are some of its most common uses:

---

#### **1. Changing Filter Context**
You can use `CALCULATE` to modify the existing filter context by adding additional filters. For example, calculating total sales for a specific product category:

```DAX
TotalSalesForCategory = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(OrderDetails[SalesAmount]), 
    Products[Category] = "Beverages"
)
```
- **Explanation**: This measure calculates the total sales from the `OrderDetails` table but only for products in the "Beverages" category. It changes the filter context by adding a filter for the `Category` column of the `Products` table.

---

#### **2. Applying Multiple Filters**
You can apply multiple filters in a single `CALCULATE` function by specifying multiple filter arguments:

```DAX
SalesForCustomerInRegion = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(OrderDetails[SalesAmount]), 
    Customers[Region] = "West", 
    Orders[OrderDate] >= DATE(2023, 1, 1)
)
```
- **Explanation**: This measure calculates the total sales for customers in the "West" region and only for orders placed after January 1, 2023. Both filters are applied to the context in which the expression is calculated.

---

#### **3. Removing Filters**
You can use the `ALL` function inside `CALCULATE` to remove any filters that might be affecting your calculation. This is useful when you need to calculate totals regardless of the current filter context.

```DAX
TotalSalesWithoutRegionFilter = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(OrderDetails[SalesAmount]), 
    ALL(Customers[Region])
)
```
- **Explanation**: This measure calculates the total sales without considering any filter on the `Region` column in the `Customers` table. The `ALL` function removes any filter on `Region`, providing a total sum across all regions.

---


#### Combining `CALCULATE` with Logical Functions
`CALCULATE` can also be combined with logical functions (like `AND`, `OR`, `IF`) to create more complex conditions.

For example, calculating sales for products that have a price greater than $50:

```DAX
HighPriceSales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(OrderDetails[SalesAmount]), 
    Products[UnitPrice] > 50
)
```
- **Explanation**: This measure calculates the total sales for products where the `UnitPrice` is greater than 50. The filter context is modified to include only those products that meet the condition.


---

### **Key Points to Remember**

- `CALCULATE` changes the **filter context** in which an expression is evaluated.
- It is used to create **dynamic measures** that respond to slicers and filters.
- It can apply **multiple filters**, modify the **existing context**, or remove filters entirely.
- `CALCULATE` is critical for time intelligence, such as calculating year-to-date (YTD), previous period, and running totals.
- It enables powerful conditional logic by combining with logical functions like `IF`, `AND`, and `OR`.
- Performance can be impacted if overused or used with complex filter expressions.
