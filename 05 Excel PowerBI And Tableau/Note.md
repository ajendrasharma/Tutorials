## **Creating and Managing Relationships Between Tables**

In Power BI, relationships between tables are essential for modeling and analyzing data accurately. Our data model for the fictitious chocolate manufacturing company consists of the following tables: **locations**, **products**, **people**, **calendar**, and **shipments**. These tables interact through relationships that enable advanced data analysis. Let’s explore the process of creating and managing relationships with examples based on your model.

----------

### **Steps to Create Relationships**

#### **1. Automatic Detection**

-   **Power BI Behavior**:
    -   When tables are imported, Power BI automatically detects relationships if the column names and data types match.
    -   Example from your model:
        -   **GID** (Geo ID) in **locations** and **shipments** might automatically form a relationship.

#### **2. Manual Creation**

-   **When to Use**:
    -   If automatic detection fails or requires adjustments.
-   **Steps**:
    1.  Open the **Model View** in Power BI Desktop.
    2.  Drag a field (column) from one table to another to create a relationship.
    3.  Use the **Manage Relationships** dialog to edit, delete, or view existing relationships.
-   **Example**:
    -   Manually creating a relationship between:
        -   **PID** (Product ID) in the **products** table.
        -   **PID** in the **shipments** table.

----------

### **Relationship Properties**

#### **1. Cardinality**

Defines the nature of the relationship between tables based on the data in the connected columns:

1.  **One-to-Many (1:*)**:
    
    -   Most common relationship type.
    -   Example:
        -   **products (1)** is linked to **shipments (Many)** via the **PID** field. A product can have multiple shipments.
2.  **One-to-One (1:1)**:
    
    -   Both tables share unique keys.
    -   Example:
        -   If every **location** has one **regional manager** (hypothetical), you could relate **locations** and a “Regional Manager” table via GID.
3.  **Many-to-Many (M:M)**:
    
    -   Both tables have non-unique values in the related columns.
    -   Example:
        -   If each salesperson (**people**) can handle multiple shipments (**shipments**) and each shipment can involve multiple salespeople, this might lead to a Many-to-Many relationship.

#### **2. Cross-Filter Direction**

Defines the direction in which filters are applied:

1.  **Single Direction**:
    
    -   Filters flow from the parent (lookup) table to the child (fact) table.
    -   Example:
        -   Filters flow from **locations** to **shipments** (e.g., filtering by a region filters shipments).
2.  **Both Direction**:
    
    -   Filters flow in both directions, which can cause ambiguity.
    -   Example:
        -   Filters flow between **calendar** and **shipments** if you want to analyze shipments across specific timeframes while dynamically updating calendars.

#### **3. Active Relationships**

-   Only one relationship between two tables can be active at a time.
-   Example:
    -   If you have multiple relationships between **people** and **shipments** (e.g., via SPID and shipment responsibilities), only one can be active. The inactive relationship can be used explicitly in DAX calculations.

----------

### **Examples from the Model**

1.  **Products to Shipments**:
    
    -   **Cardinality**: One-to-Many (1:*).
    -   **Key Column**: **PID**.
    -   **Purpose**: Analyze shipment performance or sales data by product categories.
2.  **Locations to Shipments**:
    
    -   **Cardinality**: One-to-Many (1:*).
    -   **Key Column**: **GID**.
    -   **Purpose**: Identify shipment trends and performance by region.
3.  **Calendar to Shipments**:
    
    -   **Cardinality**: One-to-Many (1:*).
    -   **Key Column**: **cal_date**.
    -   **Purpose**: Perform time-based analysis such as monthly sales trends or shipment delays.
4.  **People to Shipments**:
    
    -   **Cardinality**: One-to-Many (1:*).
    -   **Key Column**: **SPID**.
    -   **Purpose**: Measure individual salesperson contributions to shipments or revenue.

----------

### **Cardinality and Cross-Filter Direction: Examples**

#### Example: Single Direction

-   **Setup**: Filters flow from **calendar** to **shipments**.
-   **Result**: When a date range is selected in a report, shipments for that timeframe are displayed.

#### Example: Both Direction

-   **Setup**: Filters flow between **locations** and **shipments**.
-   **Result**: Filtering shipments by a specific region automatically updates the region’s metrics (e.g., sales).

### **Star Schema and Snowflake Schema**

Data modeling in Power BI involves choosing the right schema design for structuring tables. The choice between **Star Schema** and **Snowflake Schema** depends on the nature of the data and the specific use case. Let’s examine these two approaches in detail.

---

### **Star Schema**

#### **Definition**:
A **Star Schema** consists of a central **fact table** that stores quantitative data (e.g., sales, shipments) surrounded by multiple **dimension tables** that provide context (e.g., product details, dates, regions).

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Fact Table**:
   - Contains measurable values such as sales amount, shipment counts, or profit.
   - Includes foreign keys referencing dimension tables.
2. **Dimension Tables**:
   - Contain descriptive attributes like product names, region details, or time periods.

#### **Advantages**:
1. **Simpler Design**:
   - Easy to understand and implement.
   - Minimizes complexity by using flat dimension tables.

2. **Optimized for Queries**:
   - Fewer joins between tables enhance performance.
   - Ideal for large datasets with frequent aggregations and filters.

3. **Improves Performance**:
   - Streamlined structure ensures fast querying and report generation.
   - Suitable for most reporting and dashboarding scenarios.

4. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Fewer tables reduce the effort required to manage the model.

#### **Example: Fictitious Chocolate Company**
- **Fact Table**: **Shipments**
  - Columns: ShipmentID, Date, ProductID, SalespersonID, Amount, Boxes, GID (Location ID).
- **Dimension Tables**:
  - **Products**: ProductID, Product Name, Category, Cost Per Box.
  - **People**: SalespersonID, Salesperson Name, Team.
  - **Calendar**: Date, Month, Year, Weekday.
  - **Locations**: LocationID, Region, Geo.


---

### **Snowflake Schema**

#### **Definition**:
A **Snowflake Schema** is an extension of the Star Schema, where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables. This results in more granular tables with reduced redundancy.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Normalized Dimension Tables**:
   - Dimension tables are broken into smaller tables, often linked via surrogate keys.
   - Example: A "Location" table split into "City," "State," and "Country."

2. **Fact Table**:
   - Remains the central table, similar to a Star Schema, but now linked to normalized dimensions.

#### **Advantages**:
1. **Reduces Redundancy**:
   - Removes repetitive data by normalizing dimensions.
   - Example: Instead of storing the region name in every shipment record, it can be stored in a separate "Regions" table.

2. **Useful for Highly Normalized Datasets**:
   - Ideal for datasets where normalization is required due to existing systems or large volumes of data.

#### **Disadvantages**:
1. **Increased Complexity**:
   - Requires more joins between tables for queries.
   - Can be harder to understand and manage compared to the Star Schema.

2. **Slower Performance**:
   - Multiple joins increase query execution time, especially for large datasets.

#### **Example: Fictitious Chocolate Company**
- **Fact Table**: **Shipments**
  - Columns: ShipmentID, Date, ProductID, SalespersonID, Amount, Boxes, GID (Location ID).
- **Dimension Tables**:
  - **Products**: ProductID, Product Name, Category.
  - **Category**: CategoryID, Category Name.
  - **Locations**:
    - LocationID → City Table: CityID, City Name.
    - State Table: StateID, State Name.
    - Country Table: CountryID, Country Name.
  - **Calendar**: Same as in Star Schema.



### **When to Use Each Schema**

| **Criteria**              | **Star Schema**                           | **Snowflake Schema**                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Complexity**            | Simple and easy to understand.            | More complex and requires extra joins.    |
| **Performance**           | Optimized for fast queries and reporting. | Slower due to additional joins.           |
| **Use Case**              | Ideal for BI tools like Power BI.          | Useful when normalization is required.    |
| **Redundancy**            | Some redundancy in dimension tables.      | Reduced redundancy by normalizing data.   |
| **Ease of Maintenance**   | Easier to manage and maintain.            | More challenging to maintain.             |

---

### **Recommendation for the Chocolate Company**
For the fictitious chocolate company, a **Star Schema** is recommended:
1. **Reason**:
   - Simple design improves performance and ensures faster queries.
   - Works well with Power BI’s optimized handling of relationships.
2. **Implementation**:
   - Central fact table (**Shipments**) surrounded by dimensions like **Products**, **Locations**, **People**, and **Calendar**.
   - Avoid normalizing dimensions unless necessary for managing a very large dataset.
