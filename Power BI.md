## **What is Data Modeling?**

**Data modeling** is the process of creating a structured framework for organizing and connecting data to enable effective analysis and reporting. It involves defining the relationships between various data entities (e.g., tables) and ensuring the data is presented in a way that supports meaningful insights and efficient querying.

---

### **Key Features of Data Modeling**
1. **Logical Framework:** Represents data in a structured manner, highlighting how different entities are related.
2. **Simplifies Complex Data:** Breaks down raw, complex data into manageable and understandable structures.

## **Table in Power BI?**

In Power BI, a **table** is a structured collection of rows and columns that stores related data. Tables form the backbone of data models in Power BI, where each table represents an entity or a set of data points. They can be imported from various sources (e.g., Excel, SQL databases, CSV files) or created directly within Power BI.

---

## **Types of Tables in Power BI**

Power BI supports various types of tables, each with a specific role in the data model. These include:

---

#### **1. Fact Tables**
- **Definition:** 
  - A fact table contains numerical and measurable data, often representing transactional information such as sales, revenue, or inventory.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Central table in a star or snowflake schema.
  - Contains foreign keys to connect with dimension tables.
  - Stores data at the lowest granularity (e.g., each transaction or sale).
- **Examples:**
  - Sales table with columns like OrderID, ProductID, CustomerID, SaleAmount, Date.
  - Inventory table with columns like ItemID, StockQuantity, Date.
- **Use Case:**
  - Summarize and analyze metrics such as total sales, average order value, or inventory trends.

---

#### **2. Dimension Tables**
- **Definition:**
  - A dimension table contains descriptive or categorical information about the entities involved in the fact table.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Connected to fact tables through foreign keys.
  - Contains textual and categorical data like names, locations, or product categories.
- **Examples:**
  - Customers table with columns like CustomerID, Name, Country, Age.
  - Products table with columns like ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price.
- **Use Case:**
  - Filters and slices the data in fact tables for detailed analysis.

---

#### **3. Lookup Tables**
- **Definition:**
  - A lookup table is a type of dimension table that provides a reference for unique identifiers, enabling relationships with other tables.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Similar to dimension tables but often smaller in size.
  - May include a list of unique codes or identifiers (e.g., country codes, region IDs).
- **Examples:**
  - Country lookup table with CountryID and CountryName.
  - Payment method lookup table with PaymentID and PaymentType.
- **Use Case:**
  - Used to connect unrelated tables through a shared key.

---

## **Different Configurations of Data Modeling**

Data modeling configurations refer to the ways data is structured and organized within a model to facilitate analysis. Each configuration has specific use cases, strengths, and limitations. The three primary configurations in data modeling are **Star Schema**, **Snowflake Schema**, and **Galaxy Schema**. 

---

### 1. **Star Schema**
#### **Overview:**
- A simple and widely used configuration.
- Composed of a central **fact table** surrounded by multiple **dimension tables**.
- Called "star" schema because of its star-like layout.

#### **Structure:**
- **Fact Table:** Contains numerical data (e.g., sales, revenue) and foreign keys.
- **Dimension Tables:** Contain descriptive data (e.g., customer names, product categories).

#### **Key Features:**
- Denormalized structure (reduces joins and improves performance).
- Simplifies querying and report generation.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Dashboards requiring fast query performance.
- Summarized reporting like sales or marketing analytics.

#### **Example:**
- Fact Table: **Sales** (Sale Amount, Product ID, Customer ID, Date Key).
- Dimensions: **Products**, **Customers**, **Time**.

---

### 2. **Snowflake Schema**
#### **Overview:**
- A variation of the star schema.
- Dimension tables are further normalized into sub-tables.
- Resembles a snowflake due to its branching structure.

#### **Structure:**
- **Fact Table:** Same as in the star schema.
- **Dimension Tables:** Split into multiple related tables.

#### **Key Features:**
- Normalized structure reduces data redundancy.
- Requires more joins, leading to slower query performance compared to a star schema.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Complex data models with high data granularity.
- When storage optimization is a priority.

#### **Example:**
- Dimension Table: **Products** split into **Product Categories** and **Product Subcategories**.

---

### 3. **Galaxy Schema (Fact Constellation)**
#### **Overview:**
- An advanced schema with multiple fact tables sharing common dimension tables.
- Used for complex and large-scale data environments.

#### **Structure:**
- Multiple fact tables (e.g., sales and inventory) linked to common dimensions.

#### **Key Features:**
- Highly flexible for multi-faceted analysis.
- Increases model complexity and maintenance.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Enterprise-level BI systems with multiple domains.
- Comprehensive reporting across different processes (e.g., sales and supply chain).

#### **Example:**
- Fact Tables: **Sales** and **Inventory**.
- Shared Dimensions: **Time**, **Products**, **Stores**.
